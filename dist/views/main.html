<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Devers Talmage, a web developer based in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Northampton+MA&data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x89e6d73e7c8e2a05%3A0xc316750b13d8db0b!3m8!1m3!1d2485214!2d-71.6835014!3d42.0369215!3m2!1i2073!2i1258!4f13.1!4m2!3d42.3250896!4d-72.6412013" target="_blank">Northampton, MA</a>.</p>
<p>I create compelling and robust websites/web apps and software using modern, pragmatic practices. I excel in both front end and back end development, as well as data management, server administration, and deployment.</p>
<p>Currently I am working at <a href="https://represent.us/" target="_blank">Represent.Us</a>, a new non-profit working to end corruption and legal bribery in the American government.</p>
<p>When I'm not saving democracy, I enjoy traveling, discovering new music, rock climbing, and working on my own personal coding projects.  I have a BS in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.</p>
